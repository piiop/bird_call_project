I made this recording around 10am while the bird moved through the understory at or near ground level just west of where the Brookside Trail intersects the Hickory Ridge Trail at Blendon Woods Metro Park.  The bird continued calling for a few minutes after the end of this recording (out of storage space! Argh!) and around 10:15 or so hopped up on some dead branches while foraging allowing myself and a half-dozen or so other birders a chance to get a look at him.  

Recorded using a Sennheiser ME67 shotgun mic and a Sony Hi-MD recorder, model MZ-RH910. Recording edited using Audacity to apply a high pass filter and do noise reduction.

While recording a Canada Warbler in honey suckle bushes and adjacent lower branches of trees along the edge of the wood lot, a Mourning Warbler appeared lower in the same vegetation and joined the Canada Warbler's late morning singing.  All of this session's Mourning Warbler recordings: at the end of XC179676 and throughout XC179679 (XC179681 cropped from XC179679).

Recorded at Blendon Woods metro park, Columbus OH on Sunday, 17 June 2012 around 11:45am using a Sennheiser ME67 shotgun mic and a Sony Hi-MD recorder, model MZ-RH910.  This individual was in a wooded area with some open canopy and sunlit groundcover. Lots of low woody shrubs and small saplings.  The bird stayed low (< 6 feet) in relatively thick vegetation, and moved approximately 40 feet through the bushes and understory during the recording period.  Presumably the bird was foraging. A singing male has been present in this area for a few weeks now, so this bird has at least attempted to nest in the area.
