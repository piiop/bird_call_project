Bird Call Identification with Machine Learning Personal Project
# Bird Call Identification with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a machine learning model capable of identifying bird calls from species found in Ohio. It serves as a personal project to apply and expand machine learning knowledge while exploring new techniques in audio processing and classification.

## Project Goals
1. Develop a robust model for identifying bird calls specific to Ohio's avian population
2. Apply and deepen existing machine learning knowledge
3. Learn and implement new techniques in audio processing and machine learning

## Dataset
- Source: Recordings collected via API calls to [Xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org/)
- Scope: 121 bird species found in Ohio

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection
- Utilize the Xeno-canto API to gather bird call recordings from Ohio
- Collect associated metadata for each recording

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the metadata to gain insights into the dataset
- Visualize key statistics and distributions

### 3. Audio Processing
- Clean and standardize audio files
- Process audio data for consistency
- Implement data augmentation techniques
- Extract relevant features from audio files

### 4. Dataset Preparation
- Create two distinct datasets:
  1. Tabular dataset with extracted audio features
  2. Dataset of spectrograms generated from the audio files

### 5. Model Development
- Train and evaluate multiple model types, including but not limited to:
  - Classical machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests, SVM)
  - Deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs)
- Compare model performances across different architectures and datasets

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Analyze confusion matrices to identify challenging species
- Compare performance between tabular and spectrogram-based models

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: (list key libraries used, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, librosa, pandas, scikit-learn)

## Setup and Installation
(Provide instructions for setting up the project environment)

## Usage
(Explain how to run the project, including any command-line instructions)

## Results
